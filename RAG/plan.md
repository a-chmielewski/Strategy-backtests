Below is a step-by-step outline of how to implement a “Past Strategy Organizing & Summarizing” system.
1. Project & Environment Setup

        Current Structure:

        RAG/
          ├─ strategy_database/
          │   ├─ each folder is a strategy, inside each are json files with backtest results
          ├─ embeddings/ (we'll store embeddings)
          ├─ scripts/ (Python scripts)
          └─ plan.md

2. Library & Tool Selection

    Vector Database
        Choose one Python-friendly solution (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, or Qdrant). For a junior-friendly approach, you might find Pinecone or Qdrant simplest to integrate.

    LLM & Embeddings
        We have OpenAI and Anthropic. For embeddings, an easy start is OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002.
        For generation/summarization, you can choose ChatGPT models.

    Text/CLI Interaction
        For an interactive chatbot or CLI, you can use a simple Python script plus some library like PromptToolkit (for CLI) or a minimal web app (Flask/FastAPI + a library like LangChain or your own logic). Keep it simple and easy.

    Data Handling
        Use standard libraries like json, glob for file handling, and pandas if needed for tabular manipulation.

3. Data Parsing & Preparation

    Gather All JSON Files
        Ensure your 350 JSON files are in RAG/strategy_database/*.
        If necessary, rename them or keep them as is.

    Check JSON Structure
        Confirm each file has consistent keys: e.g. strategy_description, final_equity, win_rate_pct, expectancy, trades, etc.

    Create a Small Parser Script
        Pseudocode:

        # scripts/parse_backtests.py

        import json
        import glob

        def load_backtests(folder_path):
            backtests_data = []
            for filename in glob.glob(folder_path + "/*.json"):
                with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                    data = json.load(f)
                    backtests_data.append(data)
            return backtests_data

        This script will return a list of all backtest results (as dictionaries in Python).


4. Embedding the Backtest Data

    Identify Textual Content to Embed
        Each JSON includes:
            The short textual field: strategy_description.
            Optionally, you might embed a synthetic summary you generate from numeric fields.

    Embedding Script
        Pseudocode:

    # scripts/embed_backtests.py

    import openai

    def generate_text_for_embedding(backtest):
        text_snippet = (
            f"Strategy: {backtest['strategy_description']}\n"
            f"FinalEquity: {backtest['final_equity']}\n"
            f"WinRate: {backtest['win_rate_pct']}%\n"
            f"Expectancy: {backtest['expectancy']}"
        )
        return text_snippet

    def get_embedding(text):
        # call OpenAI's Embedding endpoint
        # e.g., openai.Embedding.create(...) 
        # return vector
        pass

Store Embeddings in Vector DB

    For each backtest, you’ll have something like:
        Document: The text snippet from above
        Metadata: {"filename": "xyz.json", "final_equity": 10000, ...}
    Insert these into your chosen vector database (with an ID or unique reference).
    Example (non-code outline):

        for backtest in all_backtests:
          text = generate_text_for_embedding(backtest)
          vector = get_embedding(text)
          # upsert into DB: id=some_unique_id, vector=vector, metadata=...

The Embedding Script should check if the json file has already been embedded (and saved to the embeddings folder) and skip it if so.

5. Retrieval Logic

    Formulate a Retrieval Query
        When you want to do something like “Find the best Sharpe ratio in downtrending markets,” or “Compare reasons for underperformance,” or any other query you typically:
            Convert the user’s question into a vector (embedding)
            Query the vector DB for nearest neighbors
        Then the relevant backtest documents come back as top-k results.

    Metadata-Based Filtering
        If you want to, for example, only retrieve strategies with final_equity > 0, you can add a filter in the vector DB query.

    Potential Approach
        For each user query, do:
            Generate an embedding from the query
            Perform a similarity search in the vector DB
            Retrieve top documents (the relevant backtest results)
            Pass them to an LLM to get a final summary answer

6. Summarization with LLM

    Design a Prompt Template
        You might create a system message or template that says:

    You are a trading assistant. 
    The user has asked: {user_query}
    Below are some relevant backtest results:
    {retrieved_backtests}
    Please summarize in bullet points.

Generate Summaries

    Send the concatenated text (or a condensed version) to GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 via openai.Completion.create() (or ChatCompletion.create() for the chat format).
    The model returns a summary or comparison of the strategies.
    Example prompt snippet (pseudocode):

        prompt = f"""
        You are an expert trading assistant. 
        The user asked: '{user_question}'

        Here are the relevant backtest results:
        {retrieved_snippets}

        Provide a concise, bullet-point summary with potential improvements.
        """
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
          model="gpt-4",
          messages=[{"role":"system","content": system_prompt}, 
                    {"role":"user","content": user_question},
                    {"role":"assistant","content": retrieved_snippets}],
          # ...
        )

    Handle Token Limits
        If your retrieved results are large, consider summarizing them in smaller chunks or retrieving fewer documents.

7. Interactive Chat or CLI Interface

    Basic CLI
        A simple Python script can:
            Ask you to type a query (e.g., “Which strategies had the best expectancy?”)
            Convert your query to an embedding, retrieve relevant backtest docs, feed them to LLM, then show the summary.
        Pseudocode:

        while True:
          user_query = input("Ask a question about your backtests or type 'exit' > ")
          if user_query.lower() == "exit":
              break
          # 1. embed user_query
          # 2. retrieve from vector DB
          # 3. pass retrieved docs to LLM
          # 4. print LLM's summary

    Optional Chatbot
        You can similarly build a simple web service (Flask/FastAPI) and have a UI with a chat box. The logic remains the same behind-the-scenes.

8. Testing & Validation

    Test with Known Queries
        Ask questions you already know the answer to (like “Which strategy had a final_equity > 15000?”). Check if the system returns the right info.
    Check Summaries for Accuracy
        Sometimes the LLM might hallucinate, so verify the generated text.
    Iterate
        If results aren’t relevant, adjust your embedding approach, chunking, or prompt engineering.

9. Maintenance & Expansion

    Manual Refresh
        Whenever you add a new JSON backtest result, run the embedding script again (or a partial update if you can).
    Record-Keeping
        Keep track of how many documents are in the vector database, any errors from the API, etc.
    Explore Future Features
        Possibly incorporate more data from logs or incorporate different embeddings for numeric fields if you want advanced scoring.
        Maybe implement synergy detection or strategy combination suggestions from the LLM.

10. Documentation & Readme

    Write a Clear Readme
        Explain how to run the scripts (parse_backtests.py, embed_backtests.py, cli_interface.py).
        Document environment variables (like your OpenAI API key).
    Comment Your Code
        Ensure each step is documented so you (or a new dev) can return months later without confusion.

Summary

These ten steps break down the entire project pipeline:

    Project Setup – directories, environment, version control.
    Library Selection – choose your vector DB, embedding service, etc.
    Data Parsing – load JSON files and confirm structure.
    Embedding – generate textual snippets from numeric fields + descriptions, embed them, store in DB.
    Retrieval – build a small function that does similarity search on user queries.
    Summarization – feed retrieved data to an LLM for final bullet-point explanations.
    Interactive Interface – CLI or simple chat UI for on-demand queries.
    Testing & Validation – check accuracy, refine prompts.
    Maintenance – manually rerun embedding for new backtests, keep track of changes.
    Documentation – ensure future maintainability.
